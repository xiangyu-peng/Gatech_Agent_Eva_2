'''
To compute_win_loss_ratio or to compute_average_rank_of_player, either 
1. specify the specific tournament log folder (eg: "../tournament_logs/tournament_without_novelty_4") in which case the statistics for the players for that game will be calculated or 
    eg: compute_win_loss_ratio("../tournament_logs/tournament_without_novelty_4", 'player_1')
    eg: compute_win_loss_ratio("../tournament_logs/tournament_without_novelty_4")
    
2. just specify "../tournament_logs/" in which case the player statistics will be calculated iteratively for all the tournaments.
    eg: compute_win_loss_ratio("../tournament_logs/", 'player_1')
    eg: compute_average_rank_of_player("../tournament_logs/")
    
Specifying the player name will compute statistics only for that particular player.
If no player name is specified, then statistics of all the players will be printed.
