"""
The novelty methods in here should be called after an initial game board has been set up, but before simulate has
been called within gameplay. It is unsafe to introduce novelty in the middle of a 'game'. The novelties should
only operate at the tournament level and be introduced prior to game instance simulation.
This generator should be used for the Month 6 SAIL-ON evals.
The consistency_check function should be called after all novelties have been generated. If the function finds problems
it will print them out and then raise an Exception. Otherwise, you're good to start using the updated gameboard
to start playing the game.
